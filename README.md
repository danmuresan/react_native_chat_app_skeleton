# react_native_chat_app_skeleton
React Native Chat App Skeleton

App aiming to provide a skeleton for a simple chat application (no actual business logic, just plain basic features such as faken login, chat list, call list, search, etc.).

Can be used as a starting point for something that would actually do something or as a tutorial.

Combines multiple react navigator patterns.

UI still needs tweaking (not tested at all for IOS)
